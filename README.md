# Modular

**Apply modular programming principles and patterns to build better Elixir apps.**

Modular is a toolbox that helps Elixir developers to apply modular programming principles and
patterns in their projects. It includes checks for defining and enforcing modular programming rules
& conventions as well as utilities for mapping the characteristics of a growing project.

Modular currently offers following tools:

- `Modular.Check.AreaAccess` - ensures that module access is limited to given area's public contract
